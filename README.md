# KillRush

## What is KillRush?
KillRush is a Webb app that pits players against each other in tournament style kill races without needing to be in the same match or playing online at the same time. KillRush will automatically track players games across a 24 hour period and submit their highest kill game. Players with the highest kill count will move on to the next round.
