 ## HTML deliverable

For this assignment I built out the HTML structure and content of my website

- **HTML pages** - HTML pages for a home page, login, submitting a recipe, browsing recipes, and a sample recipe.
- **Links** - The login page automatically links to the home page. The home page contains links for each category .
- **Text** - Each Recipe is in text.
- **Images** - There are pictures for each recipe. *all pictures are placeholders.
- **DB/Login** - Input box and submit button for login. The recipes and reviews represent data pulled from the database.
- **WebSocket** - The comments and reviews represent realtime commenters and reviewers.
