        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>At MeltingPot, we (I) believe in the noble quest of turning dinner into a complicated adventure. Our mission? To inspire home cooks to try out recipes they’ll probably never make. Because who wouldn’t want to scroll through endless culinary options while contemplating takeout?</p>

            <h3>Conner M. Rivera</h3>
            <p>Founder & Student</p>
            <p>Meet Conner, the self-proclaimed coding prodigy that definitely isn't brand new to HTML, who bravely decided to tackle the monumental task of creating a recipe website for his CS260 assignment. Because, you know, when you think "cutting-edge technology," you immediately think of culinary delights and cookie-cutter designs. With his unparalleled knack for procrastination and a vision that could only be rivaled by a well-assembled Pinterest board, Conner somehow managed to pull this masterpiece together in the eleventh hour. Who needs a solid grasp of algorithms when you can whip up a mediocre site about spaghetti instead? Bravo, Conner, truly groundbreaking work!</p>

        <p>We’d love to hear from you! Especially if you have tips on how to cook or if you just want to discuss why this website exists at all. Reach out to us at <a href="bad.html">contact@meltingpot.com</a>, and maybe Conner will get back to you—after he finishes binge-watching Jiu Jitsu Kaizen.</p>
